# :train: Train Schedule :train2:

The week 7 assignment was to create a train schedule using HTML, CSS, and jQuery to render a schedule with trains and their corresponding times. Firebase was used to host a globally available set of data which is then retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.
